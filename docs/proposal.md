# Project Proposal
**Project Title:** Virtual Access Control & Attendance Management System (Pure Software)  
**Group No.:** TBC  
**Project Website URL:** (GitHub Repo URL)  
**Team Name:** SoftAccess

Team Profile
- A — Backend (API, Auth, Jobs)
- B — Frontend (HTML/JS, UI/UX)
- C — Data & Testing (MySQL schema, cases)
- D — Docs & PM (proposal/URS/UML)

 1. Problem Diagnosis
- Current practice: paper sign-in or separated access & attendance; heavy manual work, errors, weak permission control.
- Target users: clubs, labs, small offices.
- Observations / interviews (to be filled with 2–3 bullet points from assigned customer).

 2. Proposed Treatment
- A web-based **virtual access** (QR/OTP/Passcode) to simulate door entry.
- **Automatic attendance** from events + roster; daily/weekly/monthly reports (CSV/XLSX).
- **Role & Policy**: door–user–time binding; audit logs.
- Example scenarios (user experience, no tech jargon): Admin exports “late list” in ≤2 clicks.

 3. Functional Features (What users can do)
- Virtual entry (QR/OTP) with timestamped event logging
- Manage doors, users, and time-based policies
- Define shifts/holidays and compute attendance
- View / filter / export reports
- View audit trail

 4. Plan of Work & Product Ownership
- **W1–W2:** interviews, use-case & sequence diagrams; info architecture  
- **W3–W4:** MVP loop (entry → event → daily report)  
- **W5–W6:** policies & shifts implemented  
- **W7–W8:** reports & export UX  
- **W9:** audit & security hardening  
- **W10:** demo, docs, test report  
**Ownership by feature:**  
A: entry & events | B: policies | C: attendance calc | D: reports & audit

 5. Success Metrics
- Manual stats time ↓ ≥80%
- Report accuracy ≥99% (sampled)
- Export “late list” ≤2 clicks
- Daily report auto-generated by 00:10

 6. Resources Needed
- **Frontend:** HTML + JS (fetch API)  
- **DB:** MySQL  
- **Diagrams:** draw.io / PlantUML  
- (Optional) Docker Compose for local run
