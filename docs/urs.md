# User Requirements Specification (URS)

## A. Introduction & Sources
Collect requirements from:
1) **Assigned customer team** (mandatory): notes & top 5 pain points  
2) Real potential users (optional)  
3) Our team as users (optional)  
> We will explicitly mark which FR/NFR/BR came from which source.

## B. Stakeholders & Roles
 Administrator: manages doors, policies, shifts, reports
 Member: performs virtual entry, views own records
 Visitor (optional): temporary access via one-time code

## C. Functional Requirements (FR)
 **FR1 (Assigned):** User can perform virtual entry via QR/OTP; system logs timestamp, user, door, result.
 **FR2 (Assigned):** Admin configures door–user–time policies; unauthorized attempts are blocked and recorded.
 **FR3:** Admin defines shifts & holidays; system computes daily attendance.
 **FR4:** Admin filters and exports reports (CSV/XLSX) by date/department/user.
 **FR5:** Audit log records who changed what and when.

## D. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
 **NFR1 (Usability):** Export “late list” in ≤2 clicks.
 **NFR2 (Automation):** Daily report generated by 00:10 automatically.
 **NFR3 (Performance):** Support ≥1,000 users, ≥10,000 events/day.
 **NFR4 (Security):** Role-based access; protected endpoints; audit trail retained ≥180 days.
 **NFR5 (Reliability):** No data loss on refresh; form validation & helpful errors.

## E. Domain / Business Rules (BR)
 **BR1 (Late):** first entry > shift.on_time + grace_min → late_min = delta minutes.
 **BR2 (Early leave):** last exit < shift.off_time − grace_min → early_min = delta.
 **BR3 (Status precedence):** Holiday/leave overrides late/early.
 **BR4 (Auth precedence):** Deny if no active policy for (user, door, current time).

## F. Elicitation & Validation Plan
 20-minute interview with assigned customer team; confirm top use cases.
 Low-fidelity wireframes to validate FR/NFR; update URS after feedback.

## G. Acceptance Criteria
 Reports match manual samples with ≥99% agreement.
 Negative tests: unauthorized access is blocked; event is logged with reason.
 Audit trail shows operator, timestamp, delta for any policy change.
