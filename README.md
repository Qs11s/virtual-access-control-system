# Virtual Access Control and Attendance Management System

## Project Overview
This project is a **pure software solution** designed to replace traditional hardware-based access control with dynamic QR codes and temporary passwords, while automating attendance tracking. It integrates virtual access simulation and automated attendance statistics to address common challenges faced by campuses, clubs, and small to medium-sized organizationsâ€”such as manual recordkeeping, complex permission management, and high risk of attendance fraud.
## Core Features
 **Virtual Access Module**: Supports dynamic QR codes (anti-screenshot protection) and temporary passwords for verification, with real-time entry/exit logging.
 **Role-Based Access Control**: Three-tier permission system for students, teachers, and administrators, with customizable access policies.
 **Automated Attendance Tracking**: Matches entry/exit records with scheduled courses or events to automatically determine attendance status.
 **One-Click Report Export**: Generates and exports attendance reports by individual, course, or venue.
 **Comprehensive Audit Logs**: All administrative actions are logged for traceability and accountability.
